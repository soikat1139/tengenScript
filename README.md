#TENGENSCRIPT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

##What is TengenScript?
  ==> So basically the name Tengen came from japanese anime Jujutsu Kaisen

  ==> Tengen is a character in the anime and he is the strongest character in the anime

  ==> So I thought why not name my programming language after him


  ==>Tengen is eternal and he has all the power,knoweldge and wisdom from the past and future

  ==>The most interesting thing about programming language is that it's building structure is simply beautiful and compelling

##What is the purpose of TengenScript?
  ==>I was studying data structures and algorithms and I was learning about how the computer works

  ==>So I thought let's implement all the things I have learned in a programming language
