This programming Language is made just simply out of curiosity.

#TENGENSCRIPT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

##What is TengenScript?
  ==> So basically the name Tengen came from japanese anime Jujutsu Kaisen

  ==> Tengen is a character in the anime and he is the strongest character in the anime

  ==> So I thought why not name my programming language after him

  ==> So I named it TengenScript

  ==>Tengen is eternal and he has all the power,knoweldge and wisdom from the past and future

  ==>The most interesting thing about programming language is that it's building structure is simply beautiful and compelling

  ==>I love all the logics and the it works

##What is the purpose of TengenScript?
  ==>I was studying data structures and algorithms and I was learning about how the computer works

  ==>So I thought let's implement all the things I have learned in a programming language

  ==>It's not like people gonna use it but it's just for fun and learning purpose

  ==>I am still learning and I am not a pro in programming

##Here is How you use can Use it:

   ==>You can use it in your terminal or command prompt

   ==>I am adding replit link so you can use it in your browser

   ==>It support's all the arithmetics and logical operators

   ==>Try calculating 2+2 or 2*2 or 2/2 or 2-2

   ==> Or complex operations like 2+2*2/2-2

   ==>You can also parenthesis to make it more complex like (2+2)*2/2-2

   ==>Unary operators are also supported like -2 or +2 or --2 or ++2 

   ==>You can also use variables like a=2 or b=2 or c=a+b or d=a*b or e=a/b or f=a-b

   ==>You can simply type your declared variables to see the value of it like a or b or c or d or e or f

   ==>You can also use logical operators like a==b or a!=b or a>b or a<b or a>=b or a<=b
